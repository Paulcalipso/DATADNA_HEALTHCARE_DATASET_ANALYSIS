# DATADNA_HEALTHCARE_DATASET_ANALYSIS
This project aims to build a Power BI dashboard using 55,500 patient records from 10 major U.S. hospitals. The data includes admissions, diagnoses, medications, insurance, and treatment costs. The dashboard will reveal trends, improve patient outcomes, reduce costs, and support data-driven healthcare decisions.
